PyCity Schools Assignment
Pandas Challenge


     Once combining the two data sets, we can see all high school students in the PyCity 
     district and their math and reading numeric grades as well as the total budget for each
     high school. From there, I made an initial summary table separated by individual schools,
     to get a overview of the entire district. Then went further and did tables for both reading
     scores and math scores by grade for each school. The final three tables were average math
     and reading scores and passing percentages based off of the school’s budget per student,
     the school size and the school type. These three tables are what you can draw a better
     conclusion from.  You can see that the budget per student table actually shows that the
     schools that were given a higher budget per student actually have lower math and reading
     score averages than the schools that were given a lower budget per student. That alone
     doesn’t mean much though because there is a wide range of school sizes within this
     district. Looking at the school size table you can clearly see that the large schools with
     over 2,000 students, had a much lower passing rate for math, reading and overall than
     schools with less than 2,000 students. Even further than that, in the averages by school
     type, it is clear that charter schools outperform district schools. Their overall passing
     rate is almost 40 percentage points higher than district schools. Overall, from this data
     set wecan see that charter schools perform better than district schools, schools with less 
     than 2,000 students perform better than schools with more than 2,000 students and budget
     per student is an unreliable metric to base school performance on. In order to get a more
     in-depth reason behind these conclusions, we would need to base it off of size as well as
     type of school and also look into the methods of teaching for individual schools. I think
     it would also be beneficial to know whether the student has an outside-of-school tutor
     which of course can greatly skew the results. I would also like to compare the socio-
     economic standings of the students that attend each school, as we know that affects
     resources available to students and in turn their grades.
